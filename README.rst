The current version of STARS is based on a refactoring to move from Numeric
to Numpy. This version should work on the following platforms

- Linux
- Windows
- Mac 


Installation
============

Currently only source installs are available:

1. Download source archive from master_
2. ``cd stars-master/stars``
3. ``python -i starsgui.py``

Mac OS X Notes
--------------

There is a bug with Tk under Mavericks resulting in slow updates of the views.
Installing `Active Python <http://www.activestate.com/activepython>`_ is a work-around.


Road Map
========

For more details on the plans for development, see
